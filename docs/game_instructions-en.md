# Game instructions for 1D Pong MK1

"1D Pong": A game for two players, batteling to shoot the ball into the base of the opponent

## Setup
* Every player chooses one side (blue left, red right)
* Player 1 (left side) starts the game by pushing his button
* After a short introduction melody the game starts

## First Ball service
The ball is placed at one players base at random. By pushing and releasing the button, the player kicks off the ball. The ball will automatically start after 5 seconds of waiting.

## Kicking the ball back
* By pressing the button, a player "hardens" his base for a short time.
* A hardened base will reflect an incoming ball
* After being hardned, a base must recover a small time until it can be triggered again.(so dont push to early)
* If the ball comes in, without the base being hardened, the base is hit and the opponent gets a point

## Next ball service
* The ball is now placed at the base that just "got shot"
* By releasing the button, the player kicks off the ball

## Extras

### Increasing velocity
* The ball will increase its velocity over time. Scoring a point will reset the velocity to the starting value.

### Ball Boost
* Pushing the button right in time, when the ball arrives, will give the ball a speed boost for that kick
* every boosted hit will increase the overall velocity more rapidly

### Barrier
* From time to time, a "barrier pill" will appear in the middle of the track.
* after hitting the ball, a player can grab the pill by **pressing and holding** the button, when the ball runs over the pill
* The player gets a 3 stack barrier, protecting his base for the next 3 incoming balls

## Game end
* The fist player, scoring 5 points wins the game
