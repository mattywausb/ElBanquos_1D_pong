# ElBanquos_1D_pong
A 1D Pong game implemented with an arduino and neopixles

I have seen multiple implementations of 1D pong and want to collect the best ideas into one game. 
* Neopixel stripe as display
* Special gimmicks (Power Pills, Labyrinths, Barriers or life)

# Roadmap / Ideas
* MK1 - Initial implementation using a 12 pixel ring. The main effort will be to implement a module architecture that can be extended an modified easy with new features. The main challenge is to implement smooth movement with 16 bit integer arithmetic
* MK2 - Extending the game to a longer pixel strip (depending on the money it will cost). This will give more options for some crazy variations (Moving bonus spots, labyriths, magnets, stacking of bonus elements, movement variations)

# Log
* MK1 is complete
